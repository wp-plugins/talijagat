== Description ==


 * This plugin makes it easy to redirect 100% of traffic for your feeds to a FeedBurner feed you have created. 
   FeedBurner can then track all of your feed subscriber traffic and usage and apply a variety of features you 
   choose to improve and enhance your original WordPress feed.

 * Setting META Tags or what are officially referred to as Metadata Elements, are found within the <head></head> 
   section of your web pages. META Tags are still relevant with some indexing search engines. You should utilize  
   your META Tags in accordance with the W3C - World Wide Web Consortium Metadata Specifications and those of the 
   search engines you are targeting. 

 * Ping-O-Matic is a service to update different search engines that your blog has updated. We regularly check 
   downstream services to make sure that they're legit and still work. So while it may appear like we have fewer services, 
   they're the most important ones. Make sure to only ping specialized services if they're relevant to your blog, 
   otherwise you'll cause an undue burden on them.
